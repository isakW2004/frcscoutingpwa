# FRC Scouting PWA - UNDER CONSTRUCTION
A lightweight, offline scouting app for FRC teams.

### Set-Up
Use a local php web server to host the website MAMP is a good option on Mac and Windows.  Clone onto your computer:
`git clone https://github.com/isakW2004/frcscoutingpwa.git`
then follow tutorials for your server software to point towards your newly cloned directory.

### Use as a Progressive Web App
This is a Progressive Web App, meaning it can be installed to almost any device. Using Chrome or a Chromium based browser (Firefox does not support installing it as an app on desktops), go to *localhost*, *localhost:8888*, or wherever your server is. You should see an install button in the address bar. If you click it, it will install the app to the hard drive and add it to the Start Menu/Launchpad. 
If you want to test on another device, due to the power of Progressive Web Apps, non-secure connections are not supported. If you get an SSL certificate, you can use HTTPS to test and install your app on other devices.
