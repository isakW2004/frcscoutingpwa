# Swerve Scout
A scouting web-app for FRC teams that works offline. This is currently in a testing phase and is set up for Team 2530.
## Features
**Works on all platforms**

Swerve works on any platform with a modern web browser. Certain features may not be available depending on the platform or browser.

**Easily share files**
All you need is a way to share files. Swerve makes this easy by using your device's native sharing features. This means you can AirDrop, use Nearby Share, message the files, and use USB drives.

**Share via QR Codes**
Don't have access to the internet or file transfers? Use the convenient QR code sharing feature to share your data visually.

**Installs like an app**
Can be conveniently added to your home screen for easy access.

**View your data with ease**
Once you have data, all you need to do is click on a team. Swerve shows you match scouting averages and graphs alongside pit scouting data.

**Works with The Blue Alliance**
Download your match scouting schedule directly from The Blue Alliance. When it's time to make your alliance selections, Swerve uses data from The Blue Alliance that works with your scouting data to give you valuable insight into your alliances.
