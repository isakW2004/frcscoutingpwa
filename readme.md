# Swerve Scout
A scouting web-app for FRC teams that works offline. This is currently in a testing phase and is set up for Team 2530.
## Features
**Works on all platforms**
Swerve works on any platform with a modern web browser. Certain features may not be available depending on the platform or browser.

**Easily share files**
All you need is a way to share files. Swerve makes this easy by using your device's native sharing features. This means you can AirDrop, use Nearby Share, message the files, and use USB drives.

**Share via QR Codes**
Don't have access to the internet or file transfering? Use the convenient QR code sharing feature to share your data visually.

**Installs like an app**
Can be conveniently added to your home screen for easy access.

**View your data with ease**
Once you have data, all you need to do is click on a team. Swerve shows you match scouting averages and graphs alongside pit scouting data.

**Works with The Blue Alliance**
Download your match scouting schedule directly from The Blue Alliance. When it's time to make your alliance selections, Swerve uses data from The Blue Alliance that works with your scouting data to give you valuable insight into your alliances.
## Basic Setup 
Visit the link attached to this repository. Depending on your browser, the app may be able to be installed to the home screen. Swerve may prompt you to install it, otherwise use your browser's menus and select "Install App" or "Add to Home Screen".

During set-up, Swerve will ask if you want to upload use a custom config file. You can create one using the information on the docs. Please note that the same config file will have to be uploaded on every scouter's device, or it may cause issues.

To make scouting assignments, go to View Data and then click create match assignments.  There are two assignment strategies available: team and posiiton. Team assignments are good for small scouting subteams and/or those with high engagement from all members. Breaks are built in between assigned matches, and scouters can delegate difficult matches as needed.
Position assignments use the driver's station position, and are good if your scouting subteam has around 6 active members at all times

To begin scouting, click "Fetch Teams" to get a list of teams at the event.
